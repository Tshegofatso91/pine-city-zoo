                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,
                    also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians
                    are counted as monkeys except apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an
                    incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included,
                    monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
                     <p>Many monkey species are tree dwelling (arboreal), although there are species
                        that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active 
                        during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent,
                        especially the Old World monkeys.</p>

                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Monkey at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
