                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The Gemsbok or South African Oryx, is a large antelope
                    in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions od 
                    Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and parts of Zimbabwe, mainly
                    inhabiting in the Kalahari and Namib deserts, areas in which it is 
                    supremely adapted for survival.</p>
                     <p>Previously, some sources classsified the related East African
                        oryx, or beisa oryx(Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>

                   <p>The name Gemsbok is from Afrikans, which itself is from the Dutch word of
                    the same spelling, meaning "male chamois", composed of gems ("chamois") +
                    bok("buck, male goat").</p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Gemsbok at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
