                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan
                    Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head;
                    round ears, and a dark hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
                    adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
                     <p>It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists
                        of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually
                        hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion
                        is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Lion at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
