                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, terrestial great apes that inhabit the tropical
                    forests of equatorial Africa. The genius Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern
                    gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is
                    highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and 
                    they are next to the closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees.</p>
                     <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25
                        and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg 
                        (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8ft 6 in),depending on species and sex</p>

                   <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical and sub tropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa</p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Gorilla at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
