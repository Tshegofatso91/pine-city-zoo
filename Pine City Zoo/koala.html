                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear,
                    is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only
                    extant representative of the family Phascolartidae.</p>
                     <p>Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal
                        areas of the island's eastern and sourthern regions, inhabiting Queensland, 
                        New South Wales, Victoria, and South Auatralia.</p>

                   <p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with
                    round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose.</p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Koala at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
