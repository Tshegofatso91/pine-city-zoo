                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda,
                    is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with
                    black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund;
                    adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m long.</p>
                     <p>It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females.
                        A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. </p>

                   <p>It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements.
                    It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost
                    entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots. </p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Panda at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
