                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
                    It is the tallest living terrestial animal and the largest ruminant on earth.
                    Traditonally giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
                    with nine subspecies.</p>
                     <p>Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species
                        due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual
                        species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns.</p>

                   <p>Six valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known
                    from the fossil record.</p>
                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Giraffe at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
